# blackjack

Blackjack is a gambling game. It is the most popular casino banking game in the world, 
        and it is descended from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. 

        Blackjack players do not compete with one another. 
        The game is a card-matching game in which each player competes against the dealer. 

        This program was created by a group of Information Technology students 
        who remade the card game as a virtual game
        that is not for gambling or other illegal activities but rather for a school requirement.
